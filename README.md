All Start Chat App

A Heroku deployed application that creates a chatroom to allow users to chat and communicate in realtime.  Though not all features are developed- initial page allows for New User Creation, Returning User Login, or Logging in as a Guest.  Logging in as a guest allows access to a chatroom with an anonymous and randomly generated username.  The app displays messages in realtime and current active users in a side bar.  The app also contains Night Mode, which upon activation, allows users to use the app in low light settings.
